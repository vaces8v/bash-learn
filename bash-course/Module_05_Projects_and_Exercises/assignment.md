# Assignment for Module 05: Projects and Exercises

## Overview

In this assignment, you will apply the knowledge and skills you have acquired throughout Module 05. The focus will be on creating a project that demonstrates your ability to set up a Bash project and develop automation scripts.

## Tasks

1. **Project Setup**
   - Create a new directory for your project. Name it `my_bash_project`.
   - Inside this directory, create the following subdirectories:
     - `scripts`: This will contain your Bash scripts.
     - `data`: This will hold any data files you may need for your scripts.
     - `logs`: This will be used to store log files generated by your scripts.

2. **Automation Script**
   - Write a Bash script named `backup.sh` in the `scripts` directory. This script should:
     - Copy all files from the `data` directory to a backup location (you can choose a location on your system).
     - Log the date and time of the backup operation to a file named `backup.log` in the `logs` directory.

3. **Documentation**
   - Create a `README.md` file in the root of your project directory. This file should include:
     - A brief description of your project.
     - Instructions on how to run your backup script.
     - Any additional information that may be relevant.

4. **Submission**
   - Once you have completed the tasks, zip your `my_bash_project` directory and submit it as your assignment.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Correctness of the project structure.
- Functionality of the `backup.sh` script.
- Clarity and completeness of the documentation in the `README.md` file.
- Overall organization and presentation of your project.

Good luck, and have fun with your project!
