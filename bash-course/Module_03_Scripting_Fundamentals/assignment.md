# Assignment for Module 03: Scripting Fundamentals

## Objectives
The purpose of this assignment is to reinforce your understanding of the concepts covered in Module 03, including variables, control structures, and functions in Bash scripting. 

## Tasks

### Task 1: Variables
1. Create a Bash script named `variables.sh`.
2. In this script, declare three variables: `name`, `age`, and `city`.
3. Assign appropriate values to these variables.
4. Print a sentence using these variables. For example: "My name is [name], I am [age] years old, and I live in [city]."

### Task 2: Control Structures
1. Create a Bash script named `control_structures.sh`.
2. Write a script that checks if a number (input by the user) is even or odd.
3. Use an `if` statement to determine the result and print "The number [number] is even." or "The number [number] is odd."

### Task 3: Functions
1. Create a Bash script named `functions.sh`.
2. Define a function called `greet` that takes a name as an argument and prints "Hello, [name]!".
3. Call the `greet` function with your name as the argument.

### Submission
- Submit your scripts (`variables.sh`, `control_structures.sh`, and `functions.sh`) as a zip file.
- Ensure your scripts are executable. You can set the executable permission using the command: `chmod +x script_name.sh`.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Correctness of the scripts.
- Proper use of variables, control structures, and functions.
- Code readability and comments where necessary. 

Good luck, and happy scripting!
