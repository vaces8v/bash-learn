# Assignment for Module 04: Advanced Scripting

## Overview

In this assignment, you will apply the concepts learned in the lessons of Module 04, which include regular expressions, process management, and debugging techniques. The goal is to enhance your scripting skills and deepen your understanding of advanced Bash scripting.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Regular Expressions

1. Write a Bash script that takes a text file as input and uses regular expressions to find and display all lines that contain email addresses.
2. Enhance the script to count the number of unique email addresses found in the file.

### Task 2: Process Management

1. Create a Bash script that:
   - Starts a specified number of background processes (e.g., sleep commands).
   - Monitors these processes and displays their process IDs.
   - Waits for all background processes to complete before exiting.

### Task 3: Debugging

1. Write a Bash script that contains intentional errors (e.g., syntax errors, incorrect variable usage).
2. Use debugging techniques learned in the lesson to identify and fix the errors in your script.
3. Document the errors you found and the steps you took to resolve them.

## Submission

- Submit your scripts as `.sh` files.
- Include a README file that explains how to run your scripts and any assumptions you made.
- Ensure your scripts are well-commented to explain the logic and flow of the code.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Correctness of the scripts and their output.
- Use of advanced scripting techniques.
- Clarity and organization of the code.
- Quality of documentation and comments.
